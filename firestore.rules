/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for ControlSage.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, assets, and controls,
 * while allowing open access to compliance frameworks, control framework mappings, and audit logs.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}` and are only accessible to the user themselves.
 * - Assets and Controls are stored under `/users/{userId}/assets/{assetId}` and `/users/{userId}/controls/{controlId}`, respectively,
 *   and are owned by the specified user. Each asset and control document contains a denormalized 'ownerId' field
 *   for fast authorization checks.
 * - Control implementations, frameworks, control framework mappings, and audit logs are stored in top-level collections
 *   and are publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Data shape is NOT strictly enforced to allow for rapid prototyping. Only authorization-critical fields are validated.
 * - All write operations require a verified, signed-in user.
 * - Public read access is granted to the `controlImplementations`, `frameworks`, `controlFrameworkMappings`, and `auditLogs` collections.
